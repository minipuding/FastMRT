# Compressed Sensing with Total Variation Minimization

We implenment the compressed sensing as fastmri do. The implementation uses the BART toolkit.

## Install BART for Linux

prepare source code:

```
git clone https://github.com/mrirecon/bart.git
```

compile source code using cmake:

```
sudo apt-get install make gcc libfftw3-dev liblapacke-dev libpng-dev libopenblas-dev
sudo chmod -R 775 /your/bart/path
cd /your/bart/path
make
```

waitting for a while, a `bart` file would be compiled at your bart path.
